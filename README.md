## 🌋 What Even Is This?

Welcome to **CatastropheERP**, the enterprise resource planning system nobody asked for — built by a developer who decided that instead of making a weather app or a calculator, they would create a full-blown ERP on their first try.

**Why?**  
Because pain builds character.  
And recruiters love character.

This project is inspired by companies like Meta — the kind that can juggle Facebook, Instagram, and WhatsApp under one umbrella without accidentally setting anything on fire.  
I am attempting the same, except with fewer employees and more existential dread.

## 🧠 Current Scope (aka: Why I’m Like This)

For now, the only feature planned is:

### ✔ Inventory Management

Because before we expand into HR, finance, billing, analytics, or world domination, we must first learn to keep track of… boxes.  
Many boxes.  
Possibly too many boxes.

More features will be added one by one, in the most chaotic and unplanned agile-but-not-really-agile way you’ve ever seen.

## 🛠 Tech Stack (It’s a vibe)

- **SvelteKit** – Because I wanted a framework that lets me pretend I'm productive.
- **TailwindCSS + DaisyUI** – Write CSS without actually writing CSS.
- **SQLite** – The database equivalent of “I’ll scale it later.”
- **Socket.IO** – Real-time updates, because nothing says ERP like pushing bugs to all clients simultaneously.

## 🚀 Why This Exists

**For recruiters:**  
To prove I can build something ambitious, self-motivated, and mildly concerning.  
If you hire me, I promise to bring the same energy — minus the sleep deprivation.

**For future me:**  
Hi.  
If you're reading this, I hope you're doing better.
